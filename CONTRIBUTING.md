  # Contributing to School Tool
  Thank you for taking the time and effort to help this amazing project continue!

  ## What's there to do?
  First, for a brief, we're focusing on doing this:
  - Creating a pomodoro timer page
  - Creating a GPT-4 Question bot
  - Making "1-Minute Lessons"
It's a very basic project at the moment.

## Quickstart
```
git clone "https://github.com/AcroFord/School-Tool"
cd School-Tool
npm install
npm run preview
```
Note: Use <code>yarn</code> instead of <code>npm</code> if you're using a different terminal

## Tasks
- [ ] Create <code>Timer.js</code> in <code>./src/components</code> (Create the timer component)
- [ ] Create <code>timer.js</code> in <code>./src/</code> (Create the actual timer page)
- [ ] Create a lessons page that can parse JSON outputted to the console in <code>editor.js</code> and display lessons in a beautified widget
- [ ] Allow publishing pages made with <code>app/editor</code>
- [ ] Create a "Study Mode" page with a timer widget, GPT-4 chat and other tools made in a study tool
